## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

In Xcode add the dependency to your project via File > Add Packages > Search or Enter Package URL and use the following url:

```
https://github.com/nandzz/Jump-SwiftUI-Coordinator
```

Once added, import the package in your code:
```swift
import SwiftUIRouter
```

### Define Paths üöô

Every flow has their given paths ( the view‚Äôs routing name ), so a path corresponds to a View. But what is these paths? If inside an app we have a section called Profile, this section can contain many paths

```
Profile {
  root
  changePicture
  settings
  editBio
  badges
}
```

Here is how you create these paths for **Jump** by using an enum. 
The enum has to conform to ContextPath and can be called with the name of your choice. 

```swift
enum ProfilePaths: ContextPath {
    case root
    case changePicture
    case settings
    case editBio
    case badges
}
```

### Create the Coordinator ü§ü

The coordinator has to conform to ##Coordinator## Type and its associated paths ( the one we just create in the section above )

```swift
class ProfileCoordinator: Coordinator<ProfilePaths> {}
```


### Create Views üì∫

Each view using jump has to conform to `ContextView`
Here is how to declare the View:

> You can avoid to type the typealias by declaring directly the presenter as below

```swift
struct ContentView: ContextView {
    
   var presenter: ContextPresenter<ProfilePaths>

    var body: some View {
        ContextContent<ProfilePaths>(presenter) { emit in
            // Use ContextContent to wrap your view passing the paths 
            // to its generic type and initialising it with the presenter injected. 
        }
    }
}
```
